#+TITLE: project outline for latex-title-generator

* idea
** take in info from command line:
1. document class (?)
2. path for new file
3. author
4. title

** create a .tex file (with a given name, at a given path)
+ use a simple REPL-style system to get new .tex file from the user

** generate metadata declarations in the new document:

#+begin_src latex
\documentclass{given class}

\author{Given Name}
\title{Given Title}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\end{document}
#+end_src

* outline
** get user input
*** REPL to get new file metadata
**** no flags (yet)
*** create the new file at given path
**** need a better way to get the path

* notes
+ if "latex" is given in title, convert the word into "{\LaTeX}"

* ideas
+ have a flag to set the author as 'Nathan Whyte' automatically
+ have a (optional) flag that sets the date
  - date will be the day that the program runs
+ handle empty path argument
  - path is set to the cwd
+ handle templates
  - for authors, document types, and section structures
+ convert '~/' to '$HOME'

* questions
+ use flags to get new .tex file info from the user?
+ use given title as part of the file name?
  - wait to create the file until after all data is collected
+ compile a PDF automatically?

* issues
** file creation/opening giving errors
+ *SOLUTION*: rust needs the full path, can't use '~/'

* tasks
- [-] get user input from command line
  - [X] prompt user to enter path, doc class, author and title
  - [ ] add flag support
    - [ ] '-h' and '--help' prints help page
    - [ ] '-n' sets the author as "Nathan Whyte"
    - [ ] '-a' sets the document class to article
- [X] create a .tex file at the given path
- [ ] fill out metadata
